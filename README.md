# COPS_OpticDataPaper

SUMMARY:
This repo contains all the C-OPS data acquired with the Takuvik instrument. This includes data from the following expeditions:
- ArcticNet ("AN") cruises from the 2011 and 2013 expeditions (open water stations only),
- Tara 2013 Polar Circle cruise (open water stations only),
- Subice2014 cruise (ice stations only),
- GreenEdge 2015 and 2016 ice camps, as well as 2016 Amundsen based stations (ice stations and open water stations),
- Sentinelle Nord 2018 international Ph.D. school (open water stations and ice stations).

CONTENT:
The repo contains a directory called "./DATA"", itself containing 2 sub-folders:
- "01_ORIGINAL" contains all the data as they have been processed initially,
- "02_REPROCESSED" contains the same data, but reprocessed so that they are homogeneous among each others, and so that they only contain the radiometric output (the derived parameters like Rrs won't be made available).

As a starting point, the repo only contains 1 folder per cruise (in both "./DATA/01_ORIGINAL" and "./DATA/02_REPROCESSED"), each of these folder containing a lorem ipsum text (to put the base of the file tree). The idea being to share only the radiometric data, the initial output (containing derived parameters) are not pasted here as it would imply that they would be available in the history of this repo.
